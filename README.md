# pyspark-starter

This is a pyspark-starter project that I use as a reference when creating a new PySpark Application.

It contains:

- 📝 my (opinionated, Palantir-inspired) PySpark Style Guide
- 🏗️ an abstract Job class that enables reading and writing from Delta Tables
- ⚙️ a sample ETL Job that contains clean code according to my Style Guide
- 🚧 automated testing on commit
